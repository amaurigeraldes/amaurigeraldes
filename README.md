### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### AmaurÃ­ Geraldes here :)
I am a European citizen, currently living in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and my goals at the moment are to live in Portugal and transition my professional career to the area of analysis and systems development such as Data Science & Analytics, with the constant desire to learn new technologies, solving problems and helping to improve people's lives, using my knowledge, experiences and skills.
